# Problems Faced:  
    Struggled finding suitable fonts that were installed in the .css file, 
    Picture too big even after resizing
    Time constraint

# Decisions made: 
    We decided to go with Copperplate font as it was the most "techno" looking one.  We all decided to go with an olive green website.  Then, we each wrote our own bios and came up with names.  We each made a track at 142 BPM for 19 bars and layered them all on top of eachother.  The audio file was implemented and we began formatting the text.  Our problem with the image was a tricky one; it was too big and we decided to try to resize it which did not work either.  We decided it would be best to leave the image too big as it is kinda funny and cuts out the character Greg who is supposed to be sort of just hanging around with the techno group, but if we had mroe tme we would have troubleshooted that further .


# Self-assessment
    I worked on the .css file and entered the proper info for the font and colors.  I wrote the Cornelius character and bio.  I also created part of the music.  I tried helping with image resizing but we couldn't find the problem.  

  
# Oier 
    Oier wrote the about section for the band and the Dark Goat character and bio, and also created part of the music.  He also helped with image resizing and formatting.  

# Tommy
    Tommy lead the website formatting and entered all info into the html file.  Tommy wrote the Greg character and bio.  He also helped with the music and imagine resizing.


Overall, I felt everyone contributed and it seemed like we all had fun making this site.
