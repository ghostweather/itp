# Midterm Documentation

 ## Phase 1
I decided to challenge myself by adding a triangle into my design.  I drew a little house with a triangle roof on the graph paper, complete with tiny windows.
## Phase 2
I started this project by looking at the code along to figure out a starting point.  Then, I found the dimensions by straight experimentation to figure out which spots controlled which dimesions.  Once I figured out how to make a line, I started changing the dimensions of the other lines by trying new numbers until it was in the right place.  Then I realized if I added two more dimensions I could make a triangle.  It took me almost an hour but I tested a bunch of different numbers until I got the triangle to sit right on top of the box.  Then I made little windows to finish off the house!
## Phase 3
I had my object, but I needed to put it into a function to be able to tile it for phase 4.  I did some googling and went over the instructions on Github but I couldn't find any direction to get started so I asked chatGPT.  It showed me how to set up the function and I now understand how to properly use the 
push() and pop() together to put the object onto the canvas.
After all of that, I realized that I did not have it set up correctly, and I copied the code from the github file and input my own shape into it to create phase3.js.
## Phase 4
This is where I really hit a brick wall.  I searched StackOverflow and nothing came up with anything I searched.  I searched for "how to make cells to tile a canvas", "How to make cells for a canvas", "how to tile a canvas with an image in p5" and I got no results. I found one stack overflow post about repeating the same function but found it mostly irrelevant to what this is trying to accomplish.  I watched youtube videos, asked ChatGPT, and I couldn't find anything to help with this part.  I eventually found how to tile the image from chatGPT, and I found a way to scale and place each image by x,y,s using nested for-loops.   I know I needed to define the cells to create a grid for it to fit in, but I couldn't figure it out and so I've resorted to fitting it as close as I can by changing the collumns, rows, and scale manually.  I asked chatGPT how to move the grid to the left because I had a little extra space that I couldn't seem to get to go away, but it also did not have a good answer for this.  I eventually asked my friend from home for help but he also was stumped.  In heinsight, I wish I had gone to tutoring or booked an office hour but I ran out of time with everything else going on.  I was able to find the numbers for the scaling, rows, collumns, and spacing through trial and error that gets the image as a grid all onto the canvas, but I was unable to implement the cell logic to get the entire "checkerboard" type of grid.

I could not figure out how to attach a PDF file, so I will add it to the reposity as its own file.  It does not seem that ChatGPT allows downloading chat logs anymore so I screenshotted it all and compiled a PDF.
