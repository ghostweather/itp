I followed a tutorial on scratch on how to make a 'chase game'.  I chose to have a dog chase bread in the MIT field.
I ran into an issue where I couldn't get a sound to play when the dog catches the bread, but I got more help from the tutorials and figured it out.  Unfortunately I couldn't find a dog bark so I'm pretty sure its still a cat meow.  I wish I would've made it so the bread disappears after being 'eaten'.
